Some Drinking Games:
 every time someone mentions their agent or manager! 
 every time quentin tarantino gives the peace sign 
 Drink anytime a celebrity is awkward. That first acceptance speech = a whole glass. 
 every time they show Ben Affleck, please don't go anywhere near a car tonight. 
when Jennifer Lawrence mentioned Weinstein 
 drink every time someone tweets about it so that you get blackout drunk and don't have to endure the pain.
 drink every time someone says the word "journey"
 every time Amy Poehler awkwardly blinks
 take a shot every time you see a bad outfit.
